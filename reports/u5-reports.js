          <h2>Question 1</h2>
          <p>You are a member of a field research team working on an island in Southeast Alaska collecting data on marten populations.  Using the mark-recapture method, your team has noticed a decline in trapping success compared to the previous two years.  The martens you do end up catching look thin and their fur doesn't seem to be in very good shape.</p>

          <h2>Question 5</h2>
          <p>There are several activities occurring in your study site that were not represented in the life table in the previous question, but which may have an impact on the marten population.  For example, locals in the area practice marten fur trapping each winter, which would reduce the survival rates of the martens.  Additionally, several new logging sites have emerged near your study site, which would reduce available habitat for the martens and also impact the habitat of their prey populations (i.e. small rodents).  Another research team studying mice populations in your area has indicated that there was a "rodent crash" last year, which would have affected the food supply for the martens.</p>
          <p>The birth rates and survival rates in the life table below have been adjusted to show the cumulative impact of each of these three factors (i.e. trapping, logging, and the rodent crash) on the marten population:</p>
