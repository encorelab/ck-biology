//         <p>Cattle farming is a key component of Canadian agriculture. However, approximately 23% of Canada’s methane emissions are from cow burps ("enteric fermentations"). This number is troubling because the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide on a 100-year time scale (Environmental Protection Agency, 2013). Some progress in methane reduction has been made by scientists who have adjusted the composition of cattle feed (Rathke, 2013), but opportunities exist to pursue more cutting-edge approaches.</p>
//         <p>Maria Niño-Soto, a self-made billionaire, has decided to become a leader in the cattle industry by finding ways to make it more environmentally friendly. Towards this end, she has started the Niño-Soto Foundation (NSF) to fund research projects that could provide new solutions to problems in the cattle industry. You have been hired by the NSF as an expert reviewer, tasked with evaluating a research proposal in order to decide if the proposed project is both possible and scientifically sound. As part of your evaluation, you will prepare a report to Maria Niño-Soto in which you explain key elements of the research and comment on its plausibility.</p>`

//         <p>The enzyme pMMO (particulate methane monooxygenase) is a key part of Dr. Heifer Sutherland’s proposed project, so you will need to understand some basic features of this protein complex and the genes encoding it. You review the literature about pMMO and learn that pMMO is a membrane-bound copper and iron containing enzyme. The structural genes for this enzyme lie in a three-gene operon named <i>pmoCAB</i>. This operon codes for the three integral membrane polypeptides: PmoC, PmoA and PmoB of approximately 23, 27, and 45 kDa, respectively, that make up the final functional enzyme pMMO (McDonald et al., 2008).</p>
//         <p>It is really important that the NSF understands that the genes contain all the information necessary for a cell to produce methane monooxygenase. You decide that your report to the NSF should contain the answers to the following specific questions in order to be able to understand the proposed project and to be able to address questions surrounding its feasibility.</p>`

//         <h2>Part 4: Genetic Sequencing of <i>pmoCAB</i></h2>
//         <p>Cloning pMMO genes in <i>E. coli</i> will allow <i>E. coli</i> to produce the methane monooxidase that oxidizes methane to methanol, the first step to converting the methane to biomass. You want billionaire Niño-Soto to understand that taking the DNA from <i>M. capsulatus</i> and cloning it in <i>E. coli</i> will result in <i>E. coli</i> producing pMMO enzyme that is identical to that produced in <i>M. capsulatus</i>. The easiest way to show this is to look at the sequence of DNA and compare it to the sequence of amino acids in the protein.</p>
//         <p>One of your colleagues has obtained the gene sequence for pmoC1 from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) site at: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/14456718" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/14456718</a> which you will use in your report to the NSF to show how the gene will be transcribed and translated to make a protein.</p>
//         <p>Here is the sequence that your colleague has prepared: <button class="unit3-view-sequence-btn">View Sequence</button></p>
//         <p>You begin reading the sequence at site 1557, which is the position that GenBank indicated as the first nucleotide of the start codon of pmoC1. As you are underlining the sets of three nucleotides and discussing how each corresponds to a codon in the mRNA and an amino acid in the protein, you read ahead and notice that your colleague must have made a mistake!</p>
//         <ul>One quick way to verify whether or not the sequence is correct is to use a BLAST search to compare your colleague’s sequence to the sequence that is actually in the database:
//           <li>1. Go to <a href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi" target="_blank">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</a>. Scroll down to "Specialized searches" and select the "Global Align" option.  Copy the DNA sequence above (colleague's sequence) and paste it into the box designated as the Query Sequence (don’t worry about the numbers or about "tidying up" the sequence by removing spaces, BLAST will do this for you).</li>
//           <li>2. Next, find the correct sequence for the pmoCAB operon from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/14456718" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/14456718</a>. Copy this sequence and paste it into the Subject Sequence box on the global alignment form.</li>
//           <li>3. Run the BLAST comparison (click the "Align" button).  On the BLAST results page, select "formatting options" and choose the alignment view “Pairwise with dots for identities" then click "Reformat."</li>
//         </ul>
//         <p>Describe the differences/non-alignments found in the BLAST comparison:</p>

//   <h2>Introduction</h2>
//   <p>Cattle farming is a key component of Canadian agriculture. However, approximately 23% of Canada’s methane emissions are from cow burps ("enteric fermentations"). This number is troubling because the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of methane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide on a 100-year time scale (Environmental Protection Agency, 2013). Some progress in methane reduction has been made by scientists who have adjusted the composition of cattle feed (Rathke, 2013), but opportunities exist to pursue more cutting-edge approaches.</p>
//   <p>Maria Niño-Soto, a self-made billionaire, has decided to become a leader in the cattle industry by finding ways to make it more environmentally friendly. Towards this end, she has started the Niño-Soto Foundation (NSF) to fund research projects that could provide new solutions to problems in the cattle industry. You have been hired by the NSF as an expert reviewer, tasked with evaluating a research proposal in order to decide if the proposed project is both possible and scientifically sound. As part of your evaluation, you will prepare a report to Maria Niño-Soto in which you explain key elements of the research and comment on its plausibility.</p>

//   <h2>The Underlying Science</h2>
//   <p>The enzyme pMMO (particulate methane monooxygenase) is a key part of Dr. Heifer Sutherland’s proposed project, so you will need to understand some basic features of this protein complex and the genes encoding it. You review the literature about pMMO and learn that pMMO is a membrane-bound copper and iron containing enzyme. The structural genes for this enzyme lie in a three-gene operon named <i>pmoCAB</i>. This operon codes for the three integral membrane polypeptides: PmoC, PmoA and PmoB of approximately 23, 27, and 45 kDa, respectively, that make up the final functional enzyme pMMO (McDonald et al., 2008).</p>
//   <p>It is really important that the NSF understands that the genes contain all the information necessary for a cell to produce methane monooxygenase. You decide that your report to the NSF should contain the answers to the following specific questions in order to be able to understand the proposed project and to be able to address questions surrounding its feasibility.</p>

//   <h2>Part 2: Explanation of Gene Sequences for Transcription and Translation</h2>
//   <p>A gene includes a number of important sequences that ensure transcription and translation of the gene: Promoter, initiation and termination sequences, RBS, start and stop codons. Briefly describe the role and function of each of these within the <i>M. capsulatus</i> (be sure to indicate whether it is important for transcription or for translation). Since billionaire Ni&ntilde;o-Soto may question why she must understand such detail, indicate why you think it is important to understand in your report to the NSF (i.e. the text box below).</p>
