The autoantibodies in lupus are called "antinuclear antibodies" (ANA) because they bind to the contents of a cell's nucleus.  As shown in the autoantibodies table (handout), there are many subtypes of ANAs, each of which binds to different proteins or protein complexes within the nucleus. According to this table, what kind of ANAs would be found in patients with SLE?`,
